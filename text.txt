	Hello! I am Teddy, A Software Developer from Kenya.
		
					I first learnt about programming from Mount Kenya University. <br />
	
					This piqued my curiosity, developed into a hobby and then a passion
					and eventually led to a career change as i was previously pursing the
					field of public health in Jomo Kenyatta Univesity of Agriculture and
					Technology.
			
					The thing I love most about coding is that there’s always something
					new to learn so it’s impossible to get bored. There’s so many ways to
					be creative and so many different problems to solve and I thrive on
					the challenge.
			
					The field having the ability for a person to work remotely is a plus.
					I am currently studying everything related to software engineering and
					looking for frontend or backend development this year.
